# GitHub Comment Etiquette

## Don't be bossy!

It takes just a few seconds to type "Any updates on this?" but it takes much more time and energy to write a report back to you. First of all, you're not maintainers boss, and they owe you nothing, not to mention a report.

These minutes could have been spent on something meaningful, so you not only steal time from the maintainer but also the whole community.

Don't write like a manager: "Why this isn't merged?" "What's the ETA?" "It blocks us!" "What are the blockers?".

## Don't demand!

Never demand anything from maintainers. Always keep in mind what maintainers' work is an act of goodwill — even labor backed by the community rarely pays more than minimum wage, so communicate accordingly.

If you need a piece of information or help, say it politely. If you want to have something done, never push.

First of all, you could have different priorities. You and your colleagues might be aligned on the same goal, but maintainers can have a different focus. Secondly, you might have a different perspective on the problem. Be ready to accept a rejection of your proposal, feature, or bug report. Yes, sometimes, bugs are features!

## Don't be noisy!

Comments like "I also have this error" and "+1" are never helpful. It's especially tempting to type such comment when it's a critical issue, but that adds additional pressure and distraction.

If you want the get the attention of the maintainer, at least contribute something. If the issue lacks stack trace or reproductions steps — add it. Don't feel capable of opening a PR? Create a minimal repo with the demo of the error.

## Don't be emotional!

When the deadline is approaching and you still have a lot to do, a bug or unexpected behavior of the code you don't control is annoyance at least. Never show it!

The maintainer has a different perspective and might not be aware of the problem even if you feel like everything is broken. If you want to get help, then be calm, objective, and patient.
